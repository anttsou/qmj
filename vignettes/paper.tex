\section*{Background}
qmj implements the results and methodology of the paper \emph{Quality Minus Junk} by Clifford Asness, Andrea Frazzini, Lasse Pedersen. In their paper, they use several measures to calculate the relative profitability, growth, safety, and payouts of a company, which they use to provide an overall quality score for a company.

This quality score is used to recommend which companies to buy and which to sell, by reasoning that quality companies are likely to outperform the market, while ``junk'' companies are likely to underperform relative to the market.

Here we use the equations and methods described in the paper, coupled with data taken from reputable online sources, in order to produce quality measurements for companies listed in the Russell 3000 Index.

\section*{Getting Started}
In order to start you off, qmj comes equipped with several data sets, including company information, financial statements, and daily stock data. To access them, call:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> library(qmj)
> data(companies) #Stores company names and tickers from the 
> #Russell 3000 index
> data(financials) #Stores financial documents for the given 
> #list of companies.
> data(prices) # Stores price returns and closing stock prices 
> #for the past two years.
> data(quality) #Stores the quality scores and the scores of 
> #its components.
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> #And more detailed data sets into what makes up quality
> data(profitability)
> data(growth)
> data(payouts)
> data(safety)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

Getting a quality data frame and a holistic summary of all its components can be done by calling

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> #market_data(companies, financials, prices)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

If you're only interested in accessing certain quality factors, such as profitability, as well as what makes it up (such as gross profits over assets (GPOA), or cash flow over assets (CFOA)) call

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> #market_profitability(companies, financials)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

\section*{Analyzing your Data}
The qmj package has stored a large number of qmj objects, which store significant amounts of information about a single company and which allows more in-depth analysis of that company. Some examples of analysis follow:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> data(qmjs)
> first_qmj <- qmjs[[1]]
> summarize(first_qmj) # Displays key information about this qmj object.
\end{Sinput}

\section*{Updating your Data}
If you're interested in inputting your own data, you can generate financial statements for a data frame of companies as follows:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> #companies #Your custom data frame of company names and tickers. 
> #The column name for tickers must be "ticker"
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> #rawdata <- get_info(companies) #Retrieves raw financial 
> #statements from google finance through the quantmod package.
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> #financials <- tidyinfo(rawdata) #Renders raw data in a format 
> #usable by other functions in this package.
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

get\_info temporarily saves your progress to the extdata folder at all stages of its process, allowing you to resume your downloading if the process is interrupted for any reason.

\subsection*{Updating Prices}
Updating prices is a separate, lengthy process, and for that reason is separated from the other functions that automatically collect financial statements. To update prices, which is necessary for calculating safety measurements, call:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> # rawprices <- get_prices(companies) #Retrieves stock price 
> #data from Google Finance for listed companies for the past 
> #two years. Also saves data from the S&P 500, retrieved from 
> #Yahoo Finance.
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> # prices <- tidy_prices(rawprices) #Renders the raw data into 
> #a form usable by other functions in this package.
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

The get\_prices function is able to save its progress as it temporarily saves its download data to the extdata folder in the package's folder.
