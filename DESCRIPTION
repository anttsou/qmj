Description: Produces quality scores for each of the US companies from the Russell 3000 
    Index, following the approach described in "Quality Minus Junk" (Asness et al., 2013). 
    The package includes datasets for users who wish to view the most recently uploaded quality 
    scores. It also provides tools to automatically gather relevant financials and stock price 
    information, allowing users to update their data and customize their universe for 
    further analysis.
