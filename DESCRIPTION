Description: Produces quality scores for each of the US companies from 
    the Russell 3000, following the approach described in 
    "Quality Minus Junk" (Asness, Frazzini, & Pedersen, 2013) 
    <http://www.aqr.com/library/working-papers/quality-minus-junk>. 
    The package includes datasets for users who wish to view the most recently 
    uploaded quality scores. It also provides tools to automatically gather 
    relevant financials and stock price information, allowing users to update 
    their data and customize their universe for further analysis.
