Description: The qmj package produces quality scores for each of the 3000
    largest US companies from the Russell 3000 Index based on the work of
    Asness et. al (2013). This includes datasets for users who just
    want to view the most recently uploaded quality scores, as well as
    tools to automatically gather relevant financial documents and
    stock price information, allowing users to update data and 
    customize their universe for further analysis.
