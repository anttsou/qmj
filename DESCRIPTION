Description: The qmj package produces quality scores for each of the 3000
    largest US companies from the Russell 3000 Index based on the work of
    Asness et. al (2013). The package includes datasets for users who just
    want to view the most recently calculated quality scores, and it also
    includes tools to automatically gather relevant financial documents and
    stock data, allowing users to update the data and customize their universe
    for further analysis. The package also provides utilities for analyzing
    the resultant quality scores and separating the list of companies into
    ``junk'' stocks, which are expected to underperform relative to the
    market, and ``quality'' stocks, which are expected to outperform.
